# Hi, I am Marcus Peixoto, a full-stack developer! ðŸ“š

Currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, I'm passionate about mathematics and programming.

My primary skill set includes languages such as C, C++, Rust ðŸ¦€, C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and MySQL databases.

Already familiar with Linux, Git, Bash, and Excel, I'm now focused on studying web development and back-end systems to apply my knowledge and gain industry experience.

Ich liebe es auch, neue Sprachen zu lernen! ðŸ’¬
