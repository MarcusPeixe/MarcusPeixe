# Hi, I am Marcus Peixoto, a full-stack developer! ðŸ“š

Currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, I'm passionate about mathematics and programming. My journey in this field began in 2017 when I joined my school's robotics club, where I learned about Arduino and developed line-following robots. Since then, I've been expanding my knowledge in various areas of computer science.

In 2018, I deepened my interest in the C language, studying low-level programming, digital circuits, and CPU architectures. Participating in competitions such as OBI (Brazilian Olympiad of Informatics) has helped me develop strong logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

In 2019, I explored different flavours of Assembly, and built an assembler & emulator for a simple 8-bit architecture: the 65C02. Subsequently, I ventured into compiler engineering, game development, computer graphics, and new programming paradigms such as functional programming.

My primary skill set includes languages such as C, C++, Rust ðŸ¦€, C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and MySQL databases. Proficient in Linux, Git, Bash, and Excel, I'm now focused on studying web development and back-end systems to apply my knowledge and gain industry experience.

Ich liebe es auch, neue Sprachen zu lernen! ðŸ’¬
